## `get Intro >>= putStrLn`
I am Henry Wang (aka theKidOfArcrania). Here you will find some of my public projects that I share. In addition to being a full-time student, I also actively play CTFs on team perfect blue. I used to write a CTF blog at https://thekidofarcrania.com.

Currently I am mostly interested in either cyber security (specifically binary analysis/exploitation), and also formal verification (though I am still learning it)

## `get Interests >>= putStrLn`
 * **Interests**: Reverse engineering (I reverse Haskell for fun), malware analysis, formal verification
 * **Liked languages**: Haskell, Ocaml, Assembly
 * **Disliked langauges**: Javascript, Java
 * **What I use the most <3**: Linux, vim, gdb (with GEF, ofc), IDA, Ghidra, Docker, i3wm, git

## `get Skills >>= putStrLn`
 * **Reversed compiled code from these languages**: Haskell, C, C++, Rust, Java, x86, MIPS, Prolog, Web assembly
 * **Written 5000+ lines**: C, Java, Python, Typescript, Javascript
 * **Written 1000-5000 lines**: Ocaml, Haskell, C++, LaTeX
 * **Familiar with (more than hello world)**: x86, Bash, Makefile, SQL, Prolog, PHP, MIPS, Powershell, perl
